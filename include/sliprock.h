 *
 * The lifecycle is as follows.  The examples assume that you are
 * using libuv for async I/O, but they work for any such library.
 *
 * 1. Call sliprock_sockaddr() to get the `struct sockaddr_storage` to
 *     connect to.
 *
 * 2. Establish the connection yourself, say by calling uv_tcp_bind()
 *     (Windows) or uv_pipe_bind() (Unix) followed by uv_listen() and
 *     uv_accept().
 *
 * 3. Call sliprock_init_pending_connection_server() (server) or
 *     sliprock_init_pending_connection_client() (client) to get a
 *     sliprock_pending_connection* pointer (or an error because we
 *     ran out of memory or failed to obtain random numbers from the
 *     OS).
 *
 * 4. Call sliprock_get_read() and sliprock_get_write() to get the
 *     pointers to use for I/O, along with the number of bytes to read
 *     and write.
 *
 * 5. Initiate asynchronous I/O using functions such as uv_tcp_read()
 *     and uv_tcp_write().  But don't do so if there are zero bytes to
 *     read or write.
 *
 * 6. When I/O completes, call sliprock_on_read() and
 *     sliprock_on_write() to notify SlipRock that I/O has occurred.
 *
 * 7. If these functions return SLIPROCK_CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED, then
 *     the connection is fully established.  If it returns
 *     SLIPROCK_ERROR, the connection should be torn down.  Finally,
 *     if it returns SLIPROCK_PENDING, repeat steps 4 through 7
 *     inclusive.
 *
 * 8. Once the connection is established, you can free the connection
 *     with sliprock_destroy_pending_connection(), or re-initialize it
 *     with sliprock_reinit_pending_connection() so that it can safely
 *     be used again.
