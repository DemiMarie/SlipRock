 * \brief Creates a SlipRock connection (server-side).
 *
 * This function creates a the server side of a SlipRock connection.  On success
 * a pointer to the connection is returned, which must be freed with
 * sliprock_close() when the connection is no longer needed.  This is not just
 * to avoid memory leaks â€“ sliprock_socket() creates temporary filesystem
 * objects
 * that must be deleted when no longer in use.
 *
 * \param name The name of the connection.  Does not need to be NUL-terminated,
 * but must not have any NUL characters in it.  Sliprock will copy this string
 * if necessary; it does not need to be kept alive by the caller.
 *
 * If name contains bytes below 0x20, is not valid UTF-8, or contains any
 * characters invalid in Windows filenames, sliprock_socket() will return
 * \p NULL and set \p errno to \p EILSEQ (in the case of invalid UTF-8) or
 * \p EINVAL (in the case of invalid characters in Windows filenames).  If \p
 * name is \p NULL, * sliprock_socket() will crash the process with a fatal
 * assertion failure.
 *
 * \param length The length of the name.
 *
 * \return an opaque pointer (of type SliprockConnection) that encapsulates the
 * state of the connection, or sliprock_Invalid_Handle on error.  Must be
 * explicitly released by the caller with sliprock_release when no longer
 * needed.
